          19th May 2019 - Andrew
        </div>
        <div class="scroll">
          We both sleep late and wake up groggy and sore. After coffee we take a little walk around the town and get some overpriced breakfast / lunch with a great view. This includes some great champagne cocktails which is the best of it. We look
          around the town a bit - all very tight and dripping wealth - it seems like every second shop is selling high end jewellery. We buy great ice cream!
          <br />
          Back at our room we book four more nights on Santorini at the more traditional Oia village. We try to plan forward a bot but decide to sleep instead - planning is so complex! After a bit of sleep I feel much better and I go to organise a
          hire
          car. With that in place we relax and head off to see the town a bit on this early Saturday evening with a high end fine dining experience planned for sunset.
          <br />
          We stop to do a wine tasting overlooking the Caldera - 6 glasses and nice cheese:
          The beautiful whites (local varietals) that we had tasted in Athens
          Thick but not too sweet desert wines - one white aged to the colour of deep amber.
          Interesting very light red full of plum flavours.
          <br />
          Then onto Koukoumavlos for ‘creative greek cuisine’ which turns out to be spectacular. Among the highlights:
          Beautiful seared tuna on whte eggplant puree. (Also a forgettable tartar)
          Campari Jelly Square
          Zucchini tartar and scallop and wasabi in millefleur like layers (spectacular)
          Strawberry semifreddo with a biscuit/chocolate base
          Eggplant tiramisu! Spectacular and weird.
          After dinner we walk a bit around the town - look at jewellery and people and chat and slowly work our way to the highest point above the cable car. We take some night photos of Santorini - it is spectacular in a 70’s movie star way. We
          head
          back through the bar district - loud and alcohol driven. A final glass of wine and a beautiful silver moon of the water at home - then bed.

          19th May 2019 - Cara

        <div class="scroll">
          Wonderful ice cream. The ice cream place is on Gold Street (appropriate for Fira) - it has loads of interesting flavours like olive, Vinsanto (Sweet wine - literally means ‘Wine of Santorini’ and comes from Ancient times), Millefeuille,
          halva. Each tub is beautifully decorated with something resembling it’s contents eg strawberry has a large fake strawberry, vinsanto has a bottle etc. There are also more Normal flavours like Pomegranate (the best of the lot), Mango, salted
          caramel, bitter chocolate, pistachio (also spectacular). I have pomegranate, vinsanto and halva today - and later in the trip have Pistacio, strawberry and salted caramel.
          <br />
          Wine tasting overlooking the Caldera: Beautiful wines and a lovely server. They come with descriptions and a plate of skewers (Feta and yellow cheese) , olives, tomatoes and bread sticks. The barley bread of Greece and islands is
          omnipresent.
          It can be hard and is delicious. The tasting is opposite the restaurant - both are looking into a square of Fira - perhaps the only one which has lots of space.
          <br />
          Dogs and cats wander the streets happily. Every dog has its tail up and looks supremely chilled - different sizes. We see 5 or 6 of them and also lots of cats (which all look like Cy in size). The restaurant has a balcony above the square -
          the staff are wonderful. ‘You are welcome’, is a common phrase delivered in a lilting accent. Our waitress says she came on holiday 5 years ago and hasn’t left. Food is lovely; we have a local red wine which is light and tasty. Andrew is
          developing a taste for brussel sprouts on this holiday, which is strange. He has ordered two dishes with them!
