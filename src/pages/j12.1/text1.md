We pack, eat and hit the road today. We need to do some distance to get back to Athens.

Cara drives an amazing country road curling along the contours of the hills - the land is green and fertile and almost empty - the occasional village on the side of a hill is all the structure we see.

Then onto the highways - this section is all tunnels and bridges - for about an hour through the mountains we go through twenty or more tunnels, some of them a kilometre long. Then down to Rio where we cross the sea on a giant bridge made in four suspended sections.

In Rio near the bridge we get some fish and chips from a local restaurant overlooking the water (and bridge) with a well deserved beer and rest. Then back on the road. We are aiming for a small town where we are booked in a resort hotel for the night. We drive through local seaside towns and find our way to this place and check in.

Then we head to their giant pool for a swim, a beer and the worst Daiquiri anyone has ever made! The pool is huge and has a great jacuzzi thing on one side. We drink and relax.

Later we eat at the resort's buffet which is all terribly institutional but the food is good and we have fun. The whole enormous place is like a luxury family hotel from 1980 - some weird time-warped idea of exclusivity.
