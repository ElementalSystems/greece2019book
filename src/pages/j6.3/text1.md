We walk down from our hotel to this fine dining establishment - this short walk takes us through some very dodgy industrial and rough residential areas - we get to the location according to the GPS but it seems incredibly unlikely.

Then a guy on the street says ‘Funky Gourmet?’ and opens a large black door ushering us through.

Inside is a different world - a stark super modern black and white bar with a perfectly elegant tall black model to welcome us - there are no external windows. We are shown up a white spiral staircase to our table - the second floor is glass roofed and glass on three sides. Around you are green trees and old broken buildings - the tables are bare with white linen and four large rocks.

We order a cocktail and set off on their gourmet menu with wine. Much of the food is theatrical - the most memorable experiences:
A picnic all laid out (the table rocks to hold the cloth) - a tiny bread basket, cheese in cheesecloth, edible plastic wrapped nuts and all kinds of goodies - really cute and served with delicious beer.
Smoking dry ice herbal experience around a fish dish.
Truffle croquettes disguised to look like truffle atop real black truffles
Red box of deserts with drawers of different things.
The service in the place is professional and very precise (even noting my ambiguous right handedness and asking) but never make us feel uncomfortable (unlike other places in this league). We walk home to relax and sleep.
