Our last day but we have some time before our flight at 10pm. We repack painstakingly for the last time. At checkout we find we have no internet so we actually need directions! Then off to the wine area with only the most poetic of instructions.

Cara’s magical navigation abilities and we find the ‘wine road’ and  head for a tasting at our first stop. We mess around  a bit and then taste various wines from the local red grape  - it’s fruity and bright wine - especially when ‘fresh’.

Then back a way to another farm (there are only 35 farms in the area; only 3 are open to the public - most are less than 30 years old) - here we are taken in hand by ‘Maria’ - a lovely and generous host who shows us around their operation and slowly tastes wine with us. The wine is excellent, again we prefer the unaged reds and buy some bottles. We talk wine and travel and food with Maria.

Then off to Athens. On the way we want to see the famous Corinth canal so we ask google to lead us. It leads us up a rough dirt track through some rough terrain to a remote point overlooking the canal - a very weird experience. We see this ancient wonder (and it is blue and impressive) from a dirt track without any tourist information or context. I think this is one perspective that no other tourist got of the canal.

Then forward, straight to the airport with some hard driving. And the usual hurrying to wait as we board aircraft, change at Istanbul, and eventually get on a flight to Cape Town at 1.55am. The end of a very long day and a wonderful trip.
