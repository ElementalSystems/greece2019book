We have some excessive ice-cream (I have a great granadilla) and walk up the central Athens streets - we see some street living folk for the first time and a few beggars. A metro ride brings us back to our new hotel - the Wyndham Grand across the street from the Stanley.

We go to the roof for a swim in the rooftop pool - this rimpool has a long waterfall against one edge and is surrounded by a glass bar through which you can see Athens and the acropolis. We drink and swim.

Later we find the roof restaurant mostly closed and service failed so we go to the ground floor restaurant which is empty and uninviting. Pissed off we walk out of the five star luxury and into a cute street taverna.

We get great food and copious amounts of cheap red wine - a great experience.
