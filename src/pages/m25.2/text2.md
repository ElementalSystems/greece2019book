Legend has it that Hera was angry with Leto so no-one would give her a place to give birth. She eventually came to Delos which has no water or natural resources and said that if she could give birth here  it would become great as a trading port. The more mundane reason is that it is in the center of the Cyclades so a good place to stop.

Sixteen lions guarded the sacred lakes. Greeks had never seen lions but had heard about them and they were fearsome mythical creatures to them. Later French archaeologists had to drain the lake to prevent malaria but they planted a palm tree to mark the spot. The palm is sacred to Leto as she gave birth under one.

There was an enormous statue to Apollo which various people wrote about but a stupid King built a palm tree statue next to it which later collapsed on it and broke it. Looters carried most bits away.

Roofs of houses were wood which is why they now have no roofs. Also no second story as the higher parts of buildings were perishable.

There is a monument to Isis on the hillside. This was a sacred island to many different people and they all felt the need to make their stamp, build their own monument to Apollo or something  similar.
