We wake up and head off to the opposite end of the island to do a few things. Firstly breakfast wine tasting at the Santos winery - this is a very touristy set up with amazing views - the wine isnâ€™t spectacular but we organise some future accommodation and get a bit of food in us. Then down the hill to the prehistoric city of Akrotiri. Little is truly understood about this town that was buried in ash in about 2000BC. The people had already fled the city before it was destroyed so no human remains or valuables were found. No-one know who the people were or what became of them but they seemed much like a modern urban society:
* Public roads and building
* Three story buildings including a weaving studio
* Sewerage and water systems
* A place where they honoured the dead (from a much older time than theirs)
* Staircases and walls cracked but then repaired from earlier earthquakes.
When they left they stored large objects under arches and tables to protect them from earthquakes. It is clear they intended to return but never did.

The entire complex is under a huge 4 acre roof with giant steel beams and columns extending 30m into the bedrock. We wonder around fascinated and imagining and hear some extra details from passing tours (as ever we are slower than everybody else). They have been excavating here since 1967 - they believe about 20% of the work is done.
