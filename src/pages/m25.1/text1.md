We wake early and complete a complex packing operation to suit our complex day. The Leto makes a pretty good breakfast buffet which we scoff through before leaving for our Delos tour.

We go to the boat to Delos who send us to the ticket booth, we queue there and get sent to another queue where we are given a bewildering collection of tickets and stickers. (Greece uses a LOT of paper except in restaurants where waiter only use mobile phones).

Eventually we get on the boat to Delos with a lot of other tourists of all stripes. The day is windy (I have my first ever hat and feel dapper in it) and the sea is rough and fun. At the sacred island of Delos we get organised into tour groups and assigned to a nice Greek tour guide (later we find out she has a MA in history and archaeology).

She leads us through the ancient city of Delos. Some of the structures here are from 2000BCE but the city was a great capital (and held the treasury of the Hellenistic league) around 500BCE.

This site has never been restored or rebuilt, almost everything has been as it was - it is huge and carries a deep sense of antiquity.
