Andrew’s hat is a white boater-style - he does look dapper in it. We meet a Canadian woman introducing her niece and friend (18yo) to greece. Turns out they all have relatives in South Africa who have emigrated years before.

Doing a tour in a group is interesting because of the guide’s knowledge (In Akrotin we almost wished we had a guide because the information was so sparse), but we are rushed from place to place in a crowd - difficult to feel the people of the place and soak in the history.

The houses are higgledy-piggledy with wonderful narrow cobbled roads between them. Houses are distinguished from the shops as they have marble columns surrounding their inner courtyards.
The courtyards have beautiful mosaic  floors - the Dionysus house has a mosaic of Dionysus and a tiger. Beautiful marble everywhere.

There are ‘guardians’ wandering around blowing whistles if anybody stands on the marble (Our guide tells us you are allowed to sit wherever you want but not stand). The houses have no windows because winter is harsh and you need the protection and warmth. The place has a difficult history. Athenians seem to be the big bad but other have sacked it, removed graves, allowed no one to be born or die there, etc
