Our last day in Meteora we’re both tired after our exertions the day before. We take some time to move room downstairs and then decide we actually want to see ‘Rousanou’ - a nunnery.

We climb the steps up to it - there are two very high bridges to cross - Cara manges to cross them without much ordeal. There is very little physical space inside this area but the views are spectacular. At midday there are way too many tour groups and it gets really confined.
We plan to go to the nearby Mushroom museum but at the last moment we decide to visit the last, lowest monastery - mostly for completion.

Although one of the lowest it has a mean climb up so most of the tourists don’t bother. We are glad we did as we find some new stuff:
A modern monks room - tiny but lovely with a great view.
The church was painted by a famous master in 1500CE, all the rest ar essentially copies of his style. I really liked some of his stuff.
Quiet spaces to sit with views
An amazing high bell tower with 360° views


As this place is lower than the rest, it is set among the rock which is all around you. We walk down and drive to the museum of mushrooms. Downstairs the place is a series of dioramas that contain lots of stuffed animals and almost no actual information. The dioramas by biome are actually pretty cool as taxidermy goes. Also three or four cases of birds categorised very randomly.
