We wake up both feeling a bit rough and very slowly get it together - I wash some clothes in a basin while C sleeps some more. We have a bit of food by the pool overlooking the amazing view. After an 11am Campari and orange we decided to go wine farming - nearby is the famous Domaine Sigalis from which we have already tasted some fine wine. Sigalis lets you taste 12 wines in their vineyards - the wines are almost wild - never watered and grown using organic techniques. The vineyard is a bit wild with vines growing chaotically and lavender and weeds here and there.

On Santorini the vines are pruned into low wide discs to protect the fruit and buds from the high winds. They serve food along with the tastings - we order the fish ceviche (excellent) and then hot chick peas with eel (brilliant).

We generally liked the wines here, memorably:
* Very clean, light white with an amazing mineral taste - also salty in the aftertaste.
* Various Assytiko (a unique Santorini Cultivar)  - unwooded but clean with great floral smells.
* Super aged dessert wine made with sun-dried grapes and aged to a deep amber colour.

Then forward to another modern wine farm above the port. This farm, Vinto Santa, is built against the cliffs and cut into the rock face. We sit on their spectacular balcony and taste wine with a great meat and cheese platter. The wine are nice but not notable.
