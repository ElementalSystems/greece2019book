Hot and exhausted we set off for the red beach nearby. We park and round the headland on a difficult path. The beach is under towering red cliffs of crumbling stone and is made from tiny black and red stones of pumice. Hard on the feet but pretty to look at.

I swim and we take some pictures and then head back to our car. Our final stop is the extreme end of the island - an old lighthouse set high above the sea. We take photos of the clear Aegean waters with gulls circling far below us. On our way out we buy some fresh cherries on the roadside and manage to navigate home without electronics!

In the evening we get turned away from our Tapas place (again) and end up at a touristy fish place. The food is pretty poor and the service non-existent but we have fun. In the town we buy a fantastic hanging sculpture that C has had her eye on and some pretty blue earrings. Some really good ice cream and frozen yogurt on the way home, then to an early(ish) bed exhausted.
