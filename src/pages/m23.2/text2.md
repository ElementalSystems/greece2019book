The staff at Selene were lovely. The older woman was so proud of the food - she must own it or be seriously involved. The younger waiter told us about the high point of the island we saw behind us - it is a monastery - well worth visiting for five minutes “with a coffee because I’m Greek”. He also points out another building half way down, embedded in the mountainside. Another monastery well hidden from pirates but don't visit there as you climb a lot of steps and it’s all locked up anyway.

He also vibed with us about visiting Japan. He, like many others here, works seven days a week for eight months, then holidays for four months (and works to pay for his travels). He loves snowboarding and wants to go to Japan but the lack of language makes it less rich as a holiday experience.

Selene served the wine us a magnificent decanter. First they place a bowl of ice then the decanter fits over it to keep the wine cool - like a sculpture.

The mastic digestive was gorgeous.
