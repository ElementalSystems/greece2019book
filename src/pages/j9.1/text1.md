We get up, score some quick breakfast with coffee and eventually decide to drive around and visit some monasteries - these spectacular constructions are built on crazy rocky outcrops so that the Turks couldn’t get them.

We drive along the high road around noon - the edges are really shear and small. Lots of giant tourist buses make things crazy - at one end is a giant traffic problem and I get yelled at by a bus driver in Greek a lot!

We stop at some view point and I take some pictures with Teddy (and get attacked by a giant wasp) - the views are incredible with rock gorges dropping off 100’s of meters. The six monasteries are built on the most unlikely crazy places. Although we planned to stop at a monastery Cara is very tense at the heights, and the roads, and the climbs and the tourists so I take her back home to sleep. I go on foot to the rock above our hotel to look at the spectacular rock pinnacle.

It’s a hard climb but I make it. Through dense forest (I see a wild tortoise - I try to talk to it but it hides in its shell). The walk climbs up old oak stairs - at the top I drink some wine sitting in the sun about a quarter way up the pinnacle. I poke around some going a bit further up the path and see some great views - then I race to meet Cara - we still plan to see some monasteries today.
