Breakfast was an extensive buffet:
* Amazing cheeses! Greek cheese are delicious. Particularly crumby, piquant cheddar-types from the islands.
* Heavenly bacon and lovely other cold meat
* Fruits and yogurt
* Lots of breads

Vangliameni lake seems more like a sanatorium than a very civilised setup as A says. Although I suppose sanitoriums are civilised.
* Lots of very overweight people. Almost a relief after the prettiness of the hotel pool and beaches.
* Woman who crosses herself before entering the water
* Man in walker heading into the water
* Pool style steps going into the water
* In the water tiny fish nibble your toes, knees etc  in bigger and bigger clouds the longer one stands still.
