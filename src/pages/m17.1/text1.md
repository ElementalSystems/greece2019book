We get up to a hot, sunny Athens and get a great breakfast (best bacon!). Then we wander down the riviera slowly. Near our hotel are a few very developed beaches and as we get closer to the Vouliagmeni lake we see more small rocky coves with clear water - the sea is very calm and people are waterskiing!

At the Vouliagmeni lake there is a very civilised set up with chairs and tables and a large mineral (salty) lake under towering cliffs. We find our way in and settle at a small table by the lake side - the place is populated by a mix of tourists and locals of all shapes and ages. We swim in the deep salty lake and dry off in the sun. The exercise feels great after all our travel. Then we walk slowly back stopping at the beach for a couple of drinks and more relax. (C likes Watermelon Breezer!). Cara swims in the dead calm Mediteranean. The folk on the beach are very varied:
* Sexy cute bikini girls
* Burnt red English tourists
* Toddlers (who like the sand?) and old crones
* Twenty-somethings playing beachball
