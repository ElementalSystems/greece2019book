As Andrew says Ikaria is so green compared to the other islands we’ve seen. It almost looks tropical. The harbour is really as quiet as it seemed last night. Evdilos is the second largest town on Ikaria but doesn’t seem to have much going on which is lovely. There are three or four restaurants around the harbour, the car hire, a few travel agents but most places aren’t open.

The only non-greek is the man who hands over our car to us - he’s a brash American which feels a bit odd.

The roads are also mostly empty. Later someone tells us that Ikaria is basically a big mountain range with people living on the coast around it. This seems to be true. Nas is barely a village - it has no shops but 5 / 6 restaurants, a pottery studio, a few accommodations and a few houses. It sits on a bend in the road that sweeps up into a ravine with water flowing down! So different to the waterless islands. We can drink the tap water here! There is also Nas beach which is famous and picturesque. Nas beach is at the bottom of the cliffs with stone stairs taking you down. The ravine meets it - green biotic swampy fresh water meets rough sea waves with a pebble beach in between.

Thea is lovely and vague. As Andrew says, the rooms are tiny but with magnificent views. We have a tiny fridge, kettle and table - the bed takes up the rest of the space. The bathroom has a loo, shower and basin with barely enough space. The water is hot and the balcony is large. We have a screen door and wonderful sea breezes, so no aircon for a while!

Wonderful evening - all their wine is homemade or made by a cousins / friends. I hear later from a couple of wine makers that “All Greeks” make / grow their own tomatoes, bread and wine. This matches a lot of what we experienced.

The menu at Thea’s is handwritten. Like many Greek places it’s divided into appetisers, salads, from the grill and from the kitchen. We choose fried zucchini flowers (yay!); feta Saganaki (feta baked with peppers and onion); pork souvlaki and pita with grilled squid. The squid is huge - just an enormous squid opened up and braaied. Weird and tasty.
