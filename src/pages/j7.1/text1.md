We have breakfast and head to Athens’ other main historical attractions - the ancient angora. This was the heart of the civil and economic city in ancient times - both the market and council rooms were within its boundaries.

Not much of it is left today (centuries of other building on the site and the reuse of much of the materials) but we walk the ancient roads and look at the remains of Stupas, temples and meeting rooms.

At the edge of the area is an almost complete temple much like the Parthenon in shape but much smaller. All of its columns and facades still stand - its pretty cool and amazing to think of those who built it and worshipped in it so long ago.

As we leave the Angora Cara is gifted a bracelet by some North African grifters - smiling she lets them tie it to her wrist as a symbol of freedom / love / etc. They obviously weren’t ready for Cara - they had to chase her down 60m up the road and coyly ask for it back shamefaced - not all tourists are marks.

We take a brief look around the ‘newer’ Roman angora and see the famous tower of the winds. This beautiful octagonal tower once housed a water clock and has an amazing domed stone roof which still stands. Each external face is carved with an image of one of the eight winds. Inside it is cool and quiet.
