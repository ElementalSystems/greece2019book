5th June

One level down in the museum is an area dedicated to the first parthenon - after the persian burnt and broke it the unhappy Athenians dug a pit and buried all the remains - this turned out really well for modernity and many pieces were excavated in good condition protected from the elements these older works still have original coloured paints.

The work from this time shows an obvious change from abstract idealism (with stupid smile) to a more naturalistic dynamic style with figures moving and stepping. We get thrown out when the place closes at 8pm. Very footsore we can hardly make it back to the Stanley to collapse  - after 10+ hours of cultural adventure we are finished! We eat out on the roof too late and then sleep.
