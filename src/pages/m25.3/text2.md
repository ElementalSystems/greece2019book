The hand of the fallen statue is in the museum. There are also two bits of torso about 200m from the plinth. The idea is that looters tried to take them but they were too heavy and they left them where they lay. Only the base remains which gives some idea of what its size must have been.

The quiet time alone is wonderful but too short. Boats are few and far between. If we didn't catch the 3pm we’d have to wait for 7.30pm which was too late for our 8.45pm ferry. But the island is very quiet - barely any tourist wait for 3pm - so we have the cobbled streets to ourselves.

Before we leave Mykonos we have an early supper at Niko’s taverna. It’s rough and ready and the food is good. We have wonderful kleftiko, tasty retsina wine, skate (dish of the day) and Niko’s special dessert - an orange cake. We eat vegetable soup and Mykonian pie (onion with herbs) for starters which are also great.

It’s quite surreal coming off the ferry in the dark. There is a long line of cars waiting. A small harbour against a steep hillside. There is much flurry and movement but the town seems very quiet after Mikonos. When we get to our hotel I’m fairly woozy - like I’m still on a boat. I lie down and we go to sleep as soon as possible.
