Luckily we missed a busload of Chinese tourists by 2 minutes at the monastery. Santorini was wonderful but had become increasingly crowded. We were told that by August the current numbers would be quadrupled. Hard to imagine. The streets and pedestrian walkways were already crowded - especially in Fira and Oia.

Leto is the only hotel on the old harbour. We have a wonderful room with a view of the harbour. The staff are wonderful and gracious. They book Delos for us and say we can leave our bags there all day and use the swimming pool for the rest of the day.

We finally eat Giros at a harbourside restaurant. Delicious! This tiny alley shopping area is called little Venice.
