We wake up and eat the last of our supplies - good polony, hard cheese, tomato brasetta and the last few cherries. We pack and head off in the car to the highest point of the island. We navigate a steep and winding road; at the top of the hill sits a pretty monastery and a military installation. We take some misty photographs of the island and walk through the monastery grounds - the view are fantastic and the gardens (which we can see but not enter) look beautiful.

There is a small chapel that we can enter - quiet and beautiful and full of golden gleaming iconography with only enough space for twenty monks to worship. Then down to the port (six u-turns) and off to Mykonos.

A fast ferry boat (boring like a plane and no outside) takes us to Mykonos. Off the ferry we find an almost empty pier but we find a taxi to take us to the Leto Hotel. The driver is full-on party, “Mykonos, you are here! Tequila!” - like a Hollywood cameo. The Leta hotel is high end and easy - we swim and take a short walk down the waterfront.

All sorts of folk here dressed casual or yuppie - all speaking different languages. We get lost in the tiny alleyways of shops and bars but get back to have a swim (very salty pool), drink and siesta.

In the evening we wander down through the shopping district and find a nice restaurant in ‘little venice’. After some nice starters and local sparkling Rose the waiter moves us to a sea facing table - great view, friendly sexy waiters.

Walking the streets later everything is louder, busier and more party. Lots of people, many of them not sober talking and bustling through the district. We wander a bit but everything is a little too much and we head for home - we have a hard travel plan for tomorrow and sleep is the wisest thing.
