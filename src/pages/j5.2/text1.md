The parthenon itself is gigantic and appropriately impressive. The huge verticality looming around you as you look up at it and the incredible weight of the supported crossbars. We learn some interesting things about its history as the second Parthenon (the first was destroyed by Persians). Also it’s role as Mosque and Church over the centuries. It basically stood intact for ages before gunpowder but was badly damaged when the turks were using it as a powder store (which got hit).

Also much about the various efforts (mostly dumb and short-sighted) to repair, restore or stabalise it. Notably modern folk the 20’s to 40’s used iron bits which expand when corroded - in 1000BC they coated the iron in lead  so that it didn’t rust.

We walk further to a look out point with a huge greek flag over the city. We take some pictures of the Parthenon - a serious Greek lady guardian stops us photographing Herbert (Teddy bear) in front of it - this is apparently illegal! She then forces Cara to delete the photos from her camera! And then makes her go back  to check they are all gone. So weird!

We take a look at the temple bits on the top, notably the six Caryatids, some of which are well preserved - both impressive and beautiful.

After much looking (and photographing) we head down and walk a way across the north side of the hill past some ancient springs and caves where the oldest cults worshipped.

Then out - very tired and footsore but not defeated. Outside we get orange and strawberry slushies - brilliant: cold, sweet and refreshing.We tramp down the road alongside the hill (buy a cookbook and more water) to the famous Acropolis Museum.
