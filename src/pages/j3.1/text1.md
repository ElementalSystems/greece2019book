We wake late; eat our last breakfast here; pay our bill and try to pack. 

I take a walk down to the beach and paddle my feet in the morning sun - I climb the rocks and take a few more photos among the scattered sun worshippers (and a cute little dog). As I return I meet Cara and we wander back among the rocky crags above the beach to say our last goodbyes to Nas and Ikaria. We are both sad to be leaving this place.

Packing is quite a procedure as we have picked up more stuff and have been stationery for 8 days but somehow it all goes in nicely. One last drive down the coast to the port - we return the car and drink and eat on the harbour side and wait for our ferry.

For long hours we sit on the perfect protected place on the outside of the ferry - reading, writing this and watching various islands go by. Soon we will be back in Athens among urban life.

The ferry arrives late but an efficient taxi setup gets us to the Stanley Hotel by midnight - a nice driver explains the landmarks as we go. The hotel is nice - good service and air-conditioning! We get some late night food from room service and get to sleep at last.
