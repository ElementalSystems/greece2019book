As we walk through to the mushroom part there is a corridor with real, flying, stuffed ducks on the wall!

Upstairs there are displays of model mushrooms mostly in real life dioramas - they are labelled as toxic / edible / non-edible and deadly.   

The  variety of colours and forms are spectacular - oranges, blues and neon greens in every form - frilly, coral like, brain-like, upright blobs and lots of variations on the toadstool shape. Apparently over 300 species are included.

We taste some boring mushrooms in their shop and buy some truffle chocolate! Later Cara drives me up the high road at sunset for one last look at the rock. We take some photos from one extreme then cruise back slowly past the tourists at the famous viewpoints. The rock is spectacular in the evening light, We stop at one end and sit on a low wall sharing a bottle of wine as the sun sets over the majestic rock. A local, large dog befriends us and curls up at our feet. At sunset we are eventually alone at this busy place.

Back down in the town we hit a new restaurant from trip advisor for something a bit different: These folk cook traditional dishes but are from a mountain community who were much more roman influenced - they have their own dialect of Greek.

The food is great; memorably a walnut and honey coated feta traditional sausage. A good meal with good wine for our last night in Metoria.
