Greek Wines are beautiful. This is completely unexpected as we were warned that they sucked.
* Sparkling wine from a Peloponnese winery like a sparkling Semillon
* Same Winery also made a Merlot we drank later which was okay - Good taste but no length or body
* Beautiful white from Santorini. Mineral, high acidity but rounded and not sharp. Like a buttery Chardonnay without the heaviness or any hint of cat.

The music that has been played in our hotel, taxis, restaurants is out of time. Great pop and rock but most of it at least a decade old.
