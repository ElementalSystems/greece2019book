This bus driver sadly screws it up and we need to walk along the way back to our accommodation with our heavy bags in the heat of the afternoon.

The Adamis suites are in the heart of Fira, a very busy bustling town. So we need to ask for directions twice; itâ€™s hard but we find our way to this spectacular accommodation - our room is beautiful and the views are spectacular across the Caldera.

We rest and at sunset sit on our balcony with cheap white wine and watch the clouds light up in pinks and oranges.

We wander through the town and pick a restaurant at random - the food was good, the wine cheap appropriate, the service easy and friendly. Back home we hot tub together in our spectacular purple bathroom.
