A lovely shared balcony looks over Santorini Caldera. What a magnificent view 40 steps down from the main drag overlooking the Caldera.

At this “Lythos” restaurant the Zucchini fried balls with herbed yogurt were spectacular. So much cheese on all the menus. Fira is filled with trendy people, restaurants and shops. Winding steps and cobbled narrow pedestrian streets (No vehicles in the centre) - Louis Vitton etc, lots of jewellery stores.
