Then onto Koukoumavlos for ‘creative greek cuisine’ which turns out to be spectacular. Among the highlights:
* Beautiful seared tuna on white eggplant puree. (Also a forgettable tartar)
* Campari Jelly Square
* Zucchini tartar and scallop and wasabi in millefleur like layers (spectacular)
* Strawberry semifreddo with a biscuit/chocolate base
* Eggplant tiramisu! Spectacular and weird.

After dinner we walk a bit around the town - look at jewellery and people and chat and slowly work our way to the highest point above the cable car. We take some night photos of Santorini - it is spectacular in a 70’s movie star way. We head back through the bar district - loud and alcohol driven. 

A final glass of wine and a beautiful silver moon of the water at home - then bed.
