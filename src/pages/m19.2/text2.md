Dogs and cats wander the streets happily. Every dog has its tail up and looks supremely chilled - different sizes. We see 5 or 6 of them and also lots of cats (which all look like Cy in size). 

The restaurant has a balcony above the square - the staff are wonderful. ‘You are welcome’, is a common phrase delivered in a lilting accent. Our waitress says she came on holiday 5 years ago and hasn’t left. Food is lovely; we have a local red wine which is light and tasty. Andrew is developing a taste for brussel sprouts on this holiday, which is strange. He has ordered two dishes with them!
