We may be too shy to demand breakfast but it isn’t made easy for us. Only the non-english speaking greek cook and Thea’s slightly surly and unhelpful son are there - he doesn't offer breakfast he just asks us if we want anything.
The restaurant has indoor space under our rooms but is mostly an outside terrace overlooking the sea. Between Thea’s and the cliffs above the sea is a small stretch of land covered with reeds and small garden plots. Quite ramshackle and lovely. It is a beautiful sunset spot and we have a favourite table right on the edge rear of the building. The terrace has a trellis with a grape vine growing over it which shades the back half.

There are several cats which hang out in this area. Over the next few days we befriended one which we name slasher. It is little and beautiful - with the colouring Mojo had - brindle and white. Unlike the other cats it is friendly even when we don’t have food although play quickly develops into clawing if one doesn’t pay attention.

The village we go to is Armenistis - a pretty tourist village (although it’s not in season so very quiet) with requisite harbour and two lovely sand beaches. Unusual here - most beaches are pebbly.

At the tourist shop where we buy a map the proprietor tells us there is no laundromat here - maybe in Agios Kirykos? Thea later scoffs at this - there is no laundromat in Ikaria, She will do a wash for us which is great as we were counting on washing clothes.
