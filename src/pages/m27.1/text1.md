We sleep long and wake late to the sound of waves, wind and birds. We get some coffee but are too shy to demand breakfast (foolishly polite for this place).

We have no plan for today but we slowly wind our way to the next town and park by the ocean - we buy some basics (coffee and biscuits) and get a hiking map of the island. Then walk up through the quiet village - the restaurant we plan to eat at is still closed (Sunday) but we find a local taverna with a leafy balcony overlooking the ocean and eat some simple food with a very tannin red wine. The owner speaks little english but we get along easily enough.

Our hotel owner (Thea) pulls up alongside us on the street and tells us off for not having breakfast - to send guests out into the world hungry offends her sensibilities. On our return journey we drive beyond our rooms to the river canyon - there is great deep fresh water pools and waterfalls - we will return to rock hop and swim.

After lunch we sleep through the heat of the day - I massage Caraâ€™s sore back and legs. We stay in for the night - watching the spectacular sunset from our restaurant balcony and drink a great minerally wine we brought from Santorini.

We write in this journal, send some messages home (all is well there) and write a trip advisor review. As darkness falls we eat, drink a little more wine and ouzo. Then to bed to read and sleep.
