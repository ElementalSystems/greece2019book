Listening to water lapping while eating at Okeanis. We had a seafood platter with - calamari, tentacles and tubes, fried  sardines (yuck), octopus (first bite was the best, softest Iâ€™ve had), smoked salmon, chips, prawns. The prawns and salmon were draped over lettuce and onion to make it look bigger - quite cheaty. Also a smashed tomato, olive, caper, onion and dwarf bread salad. Surprisingly good. The bread added darkness and texture.  And aubergine stuffed with gruyere.
