Theas’ husband has a farm where he grows all the produce and the meat we eat in the restaurant. The yogurt  is wonderful. The strawberry compote is fresh from the garden. The omelettes can be filled with bacon, feta, tomato, vegetables. The milk with the coffee is wonderful - I later find out it is evaporated milk!

The villages are quaint, clinging to the steep slopes alongside the road, goats in pens. There are three roads through the island: the one we are on splits on the other side to go left to the capital or right through the only tunnel to another seaside town we will visit later; a road we come back on going over the mountains past a military installation at the relatively harsh summit; and a road continuing from Nas going round the coast to the other side.

Today is our big explore day, which we plan to spend mostly driving the island. The interior and the other side are very sparsely populated. The other side is wilder and steeper. In every community there is the domed blue and white orthodox church. They are beautiful.

The moment at the top of the pass before we headed down the terrifying road to Agros Kirykos may be the only time I was cold in Greece. When we returned  here later it was warm. But now there was a biting cold wind and it was a relief to return to the car.

Walking routes here (and on the mainland) don’t tend to be well sign-posted. You need a local to tell you where to start. We’d read about a walk amid old oaks at the top here but couldn’t find a path. There was a stone church a little further up the road on the top of the pass but is was difficult to get to (on a bend and rough dirt incline) so we never tried.
