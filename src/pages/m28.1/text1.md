We wake and experience a great breakfast - greek yogurt and strawberry compote followed by omelettes with all kinds of stuff - really good food and coffee. Then we head off driving around the island to see a little of the villages and landscape.

We head inland through some tiny twisty roads (on Ikaria you rarely get the car out of second gear); 30-40km/h is the only sane speed because of narrow roads and very limited lines of sight.

The villages are small and loosely dispersed with little more than a single road and a few houses built along the mountain. Often a tiny taverna (almost always closed this time of year) sits near the densest part of the village. The roads climb radically and we wind our way up the mountains - near the highest parts we stop and take photos through the foresty bits. We had planned to walk a bit but cannot find the path and realise that it is too cold and windy at these altitudes for our clothing.

The road down the other side of the island is very beautiful, dramatic and exposed. Cara gets a bit terrified at the massive vertical drops over the edge as we wind our way down hairpin bends moving several hundred meters down.

We slowly travel along to the opposite coast and eventually get down to the water. We take a break and find a small pebble beach made entirely of beautiful translucent stones - it looks like a scratch patch! We paddle our feet then head up the coast.
