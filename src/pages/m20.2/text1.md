I have to leave Cara (suffering terribly) in the car for 45mins while I find the elusive Mikos Villas - through 6 phone calls and lots of strangerâ€™s help I eventually find them - then go back through pouring rain on foot to get my car. Very hard but eventually I get Cara and our stuff safe in the hotel and get a beer from Nikos himself around their beautiful pool. I sit and write this journal. Adventure - fucking hell!

Cara still seems very sore when I briefly speak to her so I head out into the town to buy some basic supplies - coffee, sugar, fruit, and some basic Mediterranean food. The town of Oia is beautiful; the main walkway is a marble path winding down between restaurants and cute shops - very different in tone from Fira but still active on a Sunday night with a mix of local and international tourists.

I buy the stuff and head back to the Nikos villas to find C still asleep. She is still not interested in food so I eat a bit and then shower and sleep.
