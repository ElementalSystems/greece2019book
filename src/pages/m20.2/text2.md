We drive through Oia, park in a very busy car park and head in on foot. Too busy and can;t find anything. Lovely waitress tries to help but can't. Eventually we return to car and head back to another car park. I am really sore and really pissed off (hate being helpless; have no maps) and so I wait in the car. 

> When A eventually returns I’m very sore and in a towering rage. I barely speak to anyone and collapse on the bed and A goes away. I hate everything at this point - discover our villa is arse-end back of Oia, tiny airplane/train shower and we can’t put toilet paper in the damn toilet because of shitty, small, British made sewer systems.

> This is hugely difficult for me for a while. It feels disgusting. Much prefer the Thai way of dealing with no  paper in toilets. It’s actually this way all over the islands. Over the next few days we get used to it. Buy plastic bags to seal our used paper in (as most hotels don’t provide this)

> When A gets back I lose it at him. He is shocked. I am hysterical. I only want to hide and go home and also freaking that I’m ruining my holiday. He tries to hold me and I scream, bringing hotel management to check. Not a proud moment!
