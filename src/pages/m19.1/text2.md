Wonderful ice cream. The ice cream place is on Gold Street (appropriate for Fira)  - it has loads of interesting flavours like olive, Vinsanto (Sweet wine - literally means ‘Wine of Santorini’ and comes from Ancient times), Millefeuille, halva. Each tub is beautifully decorated with something resembling it’s contents eg strawberry has a large fake strawberry, vinsanto has a bottle etc. There are also more Normal flavours like Pomegranate (the best of the lot), Mango, salted caramel, bitter chocolate, pistachio (also spectacular). I have pomegranate, vinsanto and halva today - and later in the trip have Pistacio, strawberry and salted caramel.

Wine tasting overlooking the Caldera: Beautiful wines and a lovely server. They come with descriptions and a plate of skewers (Feta and yellow cheese) , olives, tomatoes and bread sticks. The barley bread of Greece and islands is omnipresent. It can be hard and is delicious. The tasting is opposite the restaurant - both are looking into a square of Fira - perhaps the only one which has lots of space.
