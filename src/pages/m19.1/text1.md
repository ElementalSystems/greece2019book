We both sleep late and wake up groggy and sore. After coffee we take a little walk around the town and get some overpriced breakfast / lunch with a great view. This includes some great champagne cocktails which is the best of it. We look around the town a bit - all very tight and dripping wealth - it seems like every second shop is selling high end jewellery. We buy great ice cream!

Back at our room we book four more nights on Santorini at the more traditional Oia village. We try to plan forward a bot but decide to sleep instead - planning is so complex! After a bit of sleep I feel much better and I go to organise a hire car. With that in place we relax and head off to see the town a bit on this early Saturday evening with a high end fine dining experience planned for sunset.

We stop to do a wine tasting overlooking the Caldera - 6 glasses and nice cheese:
* The beautiful whites (local varietals) that we had tasted in Athens
* Thick but not too sweet desert wines - one white aged to the colour of deep amber.
* Interesting very light red full of plum flavours.
