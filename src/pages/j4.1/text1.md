We sleep late and wake bad! Realising we need a bit of time and space to catch up we decide to stay in Athens an extra day - we go to the roof top pool to drink, eat and swim.

All the booking things go horribly for us. The Stanley can’t have us the extra night. The Greece train site really sucks! It doesn’t work on my tablet OR a real PC (explorer or chrome) - but it fails in different ways on all three! I get really frustrated in a way only tech can get me - very bad.

So I get another drink and go find a laundromat on foot.This takes me into a very bad part of town - pakistani cell phone shops, Algerian traders, drunk addicts hanging in badly run down parks and graffiti everywhere - my kinda place so I relax a bit and clean our clothes.

While the wash is on I walk the streets, take some shots of people, places and the art. Things go well for me - I found a chinese shop selling tog bags which we desperately need to return home with all our stuff. I also buy Cara some serious pain killers (no codeine in the EU - softcore euro’s!) as we are a bit short. Also I use an ATM in Greece for the first time which seems to work for me.

Then back to the hotel for some dinner overlooking the Parthenon which is lit at night and the other hills of Athens.
