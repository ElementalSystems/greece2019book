I found the drive down absolutely terrifying and was very upset with myself. But it seemed an involuntary, phobic reaction. The drop down was vast and sheer and there was no verge (although often a fence - a low fence) and we were on the outside. I constantly felt we were going to barrel over, and so couldn’t watch much which was sad as it was spectacular.

On the other side I gathered some stones but controlled myself more than at a scratch patch.

At Therma there is local life at the harbour. When we arrive a young mother and three boys swimming, jumping off the pier and chasing around. Later a man who knows her with his two kids all come and swim. I watch his little girl - the only girl - stand on the edge of the pier and try to pluck up the courage to jump after the boys have; with her father encouraging her from the beach. I empathise so much. She even has a little tummy! She eventually moves up and I feel sad for her.

The beach is pebbles which are really hard to walk on. But the water is wonderful - warm, but not too warm like the Seychelles, and beautifully clear. You can see the bottom and for into it - nothing like the Cape Town waters.

The Ikarian pie we found elsewhere - on the mainland sold as ‘Green pie’. But this restaurant was the best. The pie was the highlight in an otherwise disappointing meal (given how Mary-Mary had been sold). That and the mastic gum (a marble sized waxy ball on a stick) - which was awesome.
