We pulled ourselves together after both having nightmarish nights with our own coffee and food on our balcony and head down to the Aio port. The traffic is extra crazy and we get involved  in a two bus cluster-fuck (I reverse the hire car into a wall!). After much maneuvering we eventually make it to the bottom. There are no short boat trips available here (sad) but we stop at a restaurant Polydoros recommended and sit right on the edge of the water. C knocks a salt cellar into the ocean with a loud plop!

The food is fantastic and the service friendly and engauging. We eat:
* Sea urchin salad/soup which is beautiful.
* Perfect, tasty, soft grilled octopus
* A fish platter with Bream, swordfish and grouper - all beautiful and taste different.

They also serve us a cucumber/herb cocktail called a ‘sunset’ - clean, fresh and refreshing. We try retsina which is clean, resiny, acidic and nice if unusual. Finally thick sweet greek coffee. Great food, well prepared.

After lunch we paddle our feet in the clear blue waters and head home for a swim and siesta.
