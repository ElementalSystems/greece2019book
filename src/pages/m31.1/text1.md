We wake slowly and after a late breakfast decide to spend the day in relaxing, reading and writing - but first we need to solve the Athen’s travel plans as our ferry to leave Ikaria is fast approaching.

After many false starts and endless refusals (seems everywhere near the parthenon district is crazy booked up for most of June) - on top of dealing with an internet connection that is both poor and unstable (also a yoga class noisily starts up in the space we are using!) we find a nice place to stay in Athens central - not our first choice of location but good enough.

In the afternoon I walk around the little town of Nas alone and down to the river on a rocky terraced path. I paddle my feet and get some good photographs (and get bitten some by biotic things). When I return the bites Cara had picked up at the winery are swollen and hot - looks very irritating and unpleasant.

We eat at Thea’s as the sun sets, trying her ‘spicy cheese’ (hot with peppers and a mix of cheese - very nice) and eat zucchini flowers with a great garlic dip.
