We stroll back to our car - feeling filled and glad - through the forest. We drive past the winery but it looks pretty closed and empty so we head home. Later we go down to the big white beach and walk along it. There are surfers in the water and a little bit of break for them. A couple of sunbathers are still out on the beach but it is wide and empty with soft white sand (hard walking). The beach is steep and the waves break hard - not great for swimming although the water is warm.

We eat at Annaâ€™s a place in Nas alongside our rooms. The food here is pretty good and Anna shows us all the dishes in the kitchen - we have her moussaka (the best in greece) which is good but dominated by potato. We order Lobster (crayfish?) - always super expensive in Greece - which is well prepared but very plain and served with arbitrary pasta.

Anna herself is kind of strange and unfriendly with a nasty tendency to touch me softly when beside or behind me - often on the neck or torso - creepy!
